Abstract. The purpose of this project is to present the triad that will modify global social structures. This article demonstrates that the model of social organization implemented in recent millennia has proven to be flawed, favoring a political caste to the detriment of the population. This has been the general rule throughout the world. Based on this, we propose an evolutionary model driven by technological advancement, inspired by the principles and values of bitcoin. We will seek to make Povo de Satoshi official, with its international recognition. Later, we will negotiate international treaties, in a peaceful and democratic way, to acquire land on all continents and establish the first private and decentralized country, called Terra de Satoshi, totally free, sovereign and independent. This initiative will be carried out in partnership with the official Tokenizer, in charge of developing and marketing the tokens necessary to transform the project into reality, aiming for global success.


Introduction:

When we seek to understand the modern history of the human species, we realize that the model of social organization in force worldwide in recent millennia has proven to be inefficient, flawed and retrograde in nature. And it has been this way on purpose, always for the benefit of governments towards individuals who are members of their respective peoples! For millennia, the model of social organization has been top-down, that is, from governments to people. This centralizing model benefits the top layer, the government, to the detriment of the bottom layer, the people, who end up remaining as modern slaves to support the governmental state machine. There is a paradox involved: the system was made not to work. And as it doesn't work, it soon reached its ultimate goal. So, the system works!
Despite keeping people trapped in this perverse system, which leads bureaucrats to luxury and the population to poverty, technology has evolved a lot in recent decades. The internet brought access to knowledge, allowing many to overcome the barriers of indoctrination and free themselves in body and soul. Now, those who have freed themselves are able to understand that there is no freedom in the current model of the last millennia. With the arrival of the 21st century - Satoshi's century - along with the advancement of time came the materialization of the asset of freedom in the Bitcoin protocol and its respective timechain. It is now possible to carry out transactions between people without a centralized government body through politicians anywhere in the world. People can exchange value freely, anyway.
Economic concepts, such as demand and supply and absolute scarcity, in addition to globalization, open and auditable code, allow anyone to participate in this new free and disruptive system, without having to ask for authorization from the bureaucrat representing the centralizing system!

Currently, the global economic system is under political control and subject to government influence. However, everything changes all the time. Nothing is forever, or eternal. Just because it has been like this for the last millennia does not mean that it will continue like this forever and ever. The necessary competition that government structures feared so much arrived in the 21st century - the century of Satoshi: Bitcoin.
With this, the time will inevitably come for its overcoming and the rise of Bitcoin as the predominant currency in the world. Bitcoin is, in essence, just superior money to the Fiat system, which will only live in history books and in some museum sections around the world. The collapse of the dollar and the entire chain of currencies controlled by governments is inevitable, and the inherent fall of their nominal values to zero is a natural and predictable consequence of the advancement of the human species. Fiat currencies’ are backed by human blood.
The day will come when the masses will understand that the dollar and the rest of the Fiat system is nothing more than a worthless number, printed infinitely. Without an intrinsic value or backed by any nominally valuable asset! Your forced course proves that, in essence, there is no value! It only exists and people use it through the strength that the system has towards individuals, and Bitcoin is a silent response to this evil inflationary monetary system! Nothing lasts forever, not even the existence of the dollar and the Fiat system! The “big bang” of the new bitcoiner economic era has already happened, now we just have to wait for it to become a reality.
For our part, we do not want war. We just want to live in peace according to our beliefs, something that unfortunately doesn't exist these days. We will seek to train our people and ensure that they live in peace and harmony in our country in a peaceful way with everyone on the planet.
If we wish to achieve true bitcoiner sovereignty and live in peace and harmony, allowing the people of this people to be truly free, without the need to support any government, the time has come for unity among bitcoiners who wish to be part of Povo de Satoshi and found the first bitcoiner nation since its inception; Terra de Satoshi. Paradise on Earth. The first private and decentralized country ever.
Since we’ve been able to count time/space, the human species has been organized centrally in governments, based on political decisions. Every human being on the planet is indoctrinated, since childhood, to see imaginary lines on the world map that separate people, called "country" or "nation". And never question themselves about any of this. For millennia, people have come together in different parts of the planet, sought recognition, and formalized the formation of  peoples and the constitution of a sovereign, free and independent nations, but controlled by their respective governments. However, all existing nations fall under the same model of social structure, centered on governments and political decisions, determining interactions between people in the community. The difference between nations is nothing but their degree of interference.

In this document, we will describe the function of each of them and explain the necessary reasons for them to go together, although they are described separately.

Povo de Satoshi
“Povo de Satoshi” is all about the formation and union between people who share the same principles and values, guided by the belief in Bitcoin. They decided to unite peacefully and voluntarily, seeking to found the first private and decentralized country, based on the principles and values of libertarianism. We will fight peacefully for the rest of eternity until we are internationally recognized as a free, independent and sovereign people to guide the decisions of our communities, with decentralized institutions, according to Satoshi's scriptures.
The creation of Povo de Satoshi emerges as a necessary response to the gaps in current social and governmental structures. This collective represents the first union of people dedicated to promoting freedom, life and respect for private property, in addition to promoting human development.
History has witnessed the struggle for these fundamental values, often compromised by oppressive and bureaucratic systems that limit individual freedoms. Povo de Satoshi emerge as a visionary community that seeks to catalyze change, focusing on autonomy, decentralization and the belief in the individual's ability to shape their own destiny. The coming together of these individuals for freedom is not just a response to contemporary challenges, but a bold statement that peaceful and voluntary collaboration can be the driving force for a freer society, in every possible way. By nurturing respect for private property and promoting human development, Povo de Satoshi stand out as a vanguard, challenging outdated paradigms and aspiring to build an environment where individual freedom flourishes in unique and inspiring ways.
Our proposal is to unite individuals from all corners of the planet who do not feel represented by any current model of social organization, without ties to any people or nation. It is intended that these people sign on a large scale a statute based on principles and values intrinsic to freedom, both in the market and in individual freedoms. This aims to formalize the first human group without politicians that modern humanity has ever witnessed.
Our goal is to obtain international recognition to formalize the first group that will adopt the philosophical ideas defended by Bitcoin. Only in this way will it be possible to achieve bitcoiner libertarian sovereignty. To do this, we will follow the following step by step:
We will initially seek 210,000 people interested in becoming members of Povo de Satoshi, signing the Statute according to its principles and values.
After this stage, we will seek international recognition through the global judicial system, aiming for acceptance as a sovereign people by all, or most, nations on the planet.
With the success of international recognition, we will seek to establish peaceful and democratic contacts with all heads of state on the planet. We intend to be an open people, promoting a proposal of good neighborliness and keeping doors open for polite dialogues with all nations and their respective peoples, in a spirit of peace. Furthermore, we will seek diplomatic interactions and, if there is interest, we will explore the possibility of commercializing land through international treaties and bilateral financial agreements beneficial to both parties, with the general and democratic consent of all involved.

     3. Terra de Satoshi
“Terra de Satoshi” is the concrete realization of philosophical theory. Designed to reflect the fundamental principles of a sustainable and collaborative society. Driven by an innovative decentralized governance structure based on tokens previously issued on the Bitcoin network, Terra de Satoshi aims to be a model of harmonious coexistence and shared progress among members of this pioneering Bitcoin-based people. After officializing the union of the first 210,000 "Satoshis" from the first collection of Satoshi's citizenship, we will form the beginning of the Sovereign Povo de Satoshi. We will seek, in a peaceful and commercial way, the recognition of all people on the planet before the International Court of Justice. The second step of the project consists of building the first community in Terra de Satoshi, with the future goal of acquiring land on all continents to establish several decentralized communities. In this way, the aim is to officially found the first private and decentralized country in history.
3.1. Private country:
We seek to establish the first private country, allowing members of Povo de Satoshi to own fractions of the Nation through tokens registered on the Bitcoin timechain. This effectively transforms each individual into the owner of the nation as a whole, in proportion to the amount invested, introducing financial democracy. In contrast to the current model of government ownership, where the government is the real owner of the nation and, therefore, of its people, we propose the idea that members of the people themselves own fractions of the nation. This model will provide direct economic participation, giving greater voice and influence to those with greater financial commitment.
3.2. Decentralized country:
There are two reasons why Terra de Satoshi will be the first decentralized country in history. Firstly, it is a pioneer in the proposal for a state without government. Terra de Satoshi will not be managed centrally by political decisions, but rather through the choices of its own people, who will be the effective owners of the nation. It will be the first nation in modern human history without a government and politicians, allowing members to self-represent themselves at the height of democracy.
The second reason that makes it the first decentralized nation is the concrete intention of acquiring land on all continents of the planet, enabling the construction of different communities or citadels. Thus, Terra de Satoshi will become the pioneering genuinely decentralized nation in history, with a presence on every continent, while remaining a single nation.

4. The 7 Pillars of Terra de Satoshi

Fig 4.1: Representation of Terra de Satoshi’s core principles.
4.1. Absolute private property:
In the current configuration of countries in which humanity is divided, the concept of property is relative to the respective government, which holds the real property and grants only the right of usufruct, which can be reversed at any time without the need to explain reasons. The conception of property transcends the approach adopted by governments, in which citizens have a “concession of use” to the detriment of actual ownership of their property. In short: the government owns the land within the nation and sells the right to usufruct to members of the people. In other words, people can only have possession, but never property, as this belongs to the respective government. There is no nation in the world today where private property is absolute. Therefore, Terra de Satoshi will be a pioneer in this concept.

Each individual, as a rightful holder, will not only enjoy the autonomy to develop and explore their space according to their needs and aspirations, but will also actively contribute to the collective enrichment of Terra de Satoshi. The token holder is the real owner, without relativizing the State of Satoshi's Earth. This conception is nothing more than the rescue of the meaning of “private property”, where the guarantee of this right becomes an essential pillar in the construction of a society based on values of self-determination and collaboration. There will be no state property of any kind in Terra de Satoshi, leaving it up to the residents in a free market environment to offer the necessary solutions for the functioning of the nation. There will be no state ownership, no state company, nor will the state be able to take ownership of any real owner of the respective token without the general consent of the other members of Povo de Satoshi. Ownership will not be relative to the State as it works today, where the real owner of everything and everyone is the government of the respective country.



4.2. Self-represented democracy:
We seek to formalize the first nation in the world where members represent themselves, which we consider the pinnacle of democracy. A governance model designed to establish direct democracy based on the issuance and use of tokens, rejecting the flaws inherent in the traditional representative democracy system. This innovative paradigm ensures that each resident has an active voice in collective decisions, mitigating the challenges associated with indirect representation. Possession of tokens not only symbolizes participation in the decision-making process, but also confers proportional power, promoting transparency. This dynamic system of direct and decentralized governance allows Povo de Satoshi to actively participate in formulating policies, developing standards and executing initiatives, aligning more closely with individual desires and values.
We believe that this model represents the pinnacle of modern democracy, as members of Povo de Satoshi will have the opportunity to represent themselves. Those who own the token will have a direct voice in collective decisions, proportional to the amount invested. We call this the democracy of money, unlike the rest of the world that follows the model of representative democracy. In the latter, people are not responsible for themselves and are forced to delegate representation to third parties. We believe that this centralizing model is the cause of collective problems, and that is why we propose a decentralized model of governance, where each member of the people can represent themselves.
Therefore, we will have the correct incentive for progress, since each member of Povo de Satoshi will have property corresponding to the amount invested in the country. Naturally, it will seek a financial return, which inevitably generates a direct interest in ensuring the optimized functioning of all operations.

4.3. Tax abolition:
There will never be any taxes whatsoever in Terra de Satoshi, of any nature or at any time. In Terra de Satoshi, a distinctive and evolutionary feature is the complete abolition of the traditional tax system. Povo de Satoshi reject conventional tax imposition in favor of an approach that recognizes the financial autonomy of its inhabitants. By eliminating the tax burden, Terra de Satoshi aims to foster a vibrant and self-sustainable economy, allowing residents to fully direct their resources towards personal development, productive activities and community strengthening.
This absence of taxes not only encourages individual economic freedom, but also reflects the commitment to creating an alternative model, where there are the right incentives for progress and which is thus naturally driven by efficiency, collaboration and respect for the financial autonomy of each member. All the needs for the functioning of the nation, such as health, security, justice, education and others, will be offered and developed by the residents themselves in an environment of commercial freedom, with the state not competing as a business asset in the nation. Everything will be developed and provided by the members of the nation themselves, in an environment of market freedom, which will, through competition, provide all the needs for the functioning of the communities in Terra de Satoshi. We invite everyone in the world to bring or build wealth in Terra de Satoshi and we promise before the eyes of the world that Terra de Satoshi will never tax even one Satoshi!

4.4 Free market:
Terra de Satoshi aims to be the nation with the greatest economic freedom that human history has ever known! We will build a nation based on a free market environment that embraces the principles of economic freedom and international trade. This pioneering space rejects commercial restrictions, encouraging the free exchange of goods, services and ideas between its inhabitants and beyond its borders. The absence of trade barriers, the absence of taxes and the emphasis on freedom of transactions reflect the commitment of Terra de Satoshi to becoming a dynamic and prosperous center, where commercial exchanges unfold unhindered, driving economic development and interconnectivity globally. No international barriers or taxes of any kind.
4.5. Individual freedom
In Terra de Satoshi, respect for individual freedoms is a fundamental principle that shapes the social and legal structure of the community. Freedom should not be granted, it is a natural human principle that must be preserved and respected. The decentralized governance model, based on tokens and direct democracy, serves as a guarantor of the protection of these freedoms, ensuring that every voice is heard and every right is preserved. Furthermore, the absence of tax impositions and the emphasis on individual property reinforce Terra de Satoshi’s commitment to creating an environment where individual freedom is respected as an inalienable value, allowing inhabitants to live according to their own principles and choices. Therefore, it is not up to Terra de Satoshi to determine who a person can or cannot marry, or what a person can or cannot sell, nor will it determine what a person can or cannot use on their body, as long as it never directly interferes with the lives of third parties through the principle of “non-aggression”. If you don't initiate aggression against someone, you are free to do whatever you want. Furthermore, it is clear that one has the inalienable right to be able to defend oneself.

4.6. Non-aggression ethics:
In Terra de Satoshi, coexistence is guided by the fundamental principles of libertarian ethics and respect for the principle of non-aggression. Individual freedom is sacred and voluntary cooperation is the foundation of all social interactions. The principle of non-aggression, central to libertarian ethics, establishes that relationships between inhabitants must be guided by mutual respect, avoiding coercion and the use of force. This commitment creates an environment of trust and collaboration, where differences are resolved peacefully and individual choices are respected. In Terra de Satoshi, libertarian ethics are not just an ideal, but a practical guide for coexistence, encouraging autonomy, individual responsibility and the voluntary construction of relationships based on freedom and mutual respect.
4.7. A Society Based on Private Laws and Justice:
The main foundation of Terra de Satoshi is its status with principles and values inherent to libertarianism materialized in the philosophical questions that Bitcoin carries. Each member of Povo de Satoshi may propose a law at any time, as long as it does not conflict with the statute, and it will be enacted when it reaches the minimum number of 79% approval of all tokens related to Satoshi's citizenship in the respective unit. from Terra de Satoshi, as we will describe in more detail below. In other words, if there is less than 21% rejection, the law will be enacted. In this way, a society of private laws will be established, since the members themselves will be able to propose and vote on the law in question. It will be their responsibility to seek ways to achieve justice through a free market environment.
At the apex of the social hierarchy, both in Povo de Satoshi and in any community in Terra de Satoshi, there is the Statute, containing the fundamental principles and values. This serves as the main source of social consent, with all legislation hierarchically subordinate to it, so that:
Any citizen of Povo de Satoshi has the right to propose a law at any time, as long as it complies with the principles and values of the Statute. Terra de Satoshi stands out as the most democratic country on the planet, allowing citizens to represent themselves. Satoshi's citizenship and possession of the token key guarantee the right to vote.
For a law to come into force, it is necessary to achieve approval of 79% of the existing tokens in the respective community. This implies that the minimum rejection rate for the approval of a law must be 21%, representing the difference of 79%.
Terra de Satoshi will be one of the most notable of democracies, as each member of Povo de Satoshi will have the right to propose a law at any time, and all members will be able to vote directly. This eliminates the need for intermediation by politicians, both in proposing and voting on laws. Representing the height of direct democracy, this system overcomes the limitations of representative democracy.
And in addition to the legislative issue, each member of Povo de Satoshi will also have the right to vote to add, delete or change the Statute with the principles and values. However, this change will require unanimous acceptance, that is, 100% approval by all members of Povo de Satoshi.

5. Bitcoin Tokenizer
The Tokenizer is the third part of the triad, aiming to establish a partnership with the People and Terra de Satoshi. It will develop and market all tokens related to the union of Povo de Satoshi and, consequently, the respective decentralized communities of Terra de Satoshi, in addition to serving as a networking platform between members participating in the project.
Although Povo de Satoshi and Terra de Satoshi are decentralized and non-interdependent projects, both are interconnected through the issuance of tokens, an activity conducted by Tokenizer. The proposal is to develop and sell collections of tokens and NFTs on the Bitcoin network, for the purpose of registering ownership and participation of members of Povo de Satoshi. This includes collections such as Satoshi Citizenship, Satoshi Embassy, residential land, commercial land and the general commercial sector (hotels, nightclubs, shops, restaurants, etc.). Additionally, there will be a collection dedicated to any member of Povo de Satoshi who wants to bring their own project or idea to market. The proposed platform will serve as a link between members of Povo de Satoshi and the various decentralized communities of Terra de Satoshi, which will be built in a distributed manner around the world.
This initiative not only establishes a tangible connection between token ownership and membership in Terra de Satoshi, but also symbolizes a bold step towards more innovative and inclusive ways of building communities based on libertarian values and decentralization. The amount collected in the collections backed by both the People and Terra de Satoshi will aim to subsidize the project of founding the first private and decentralized nation of all time. The capital raised through the collections that come from this whitepaper belongs to Povo de Satoshi and has the clear and defined objective of subsidizing and sustaining the project, both in the acquisition of land and in diplomatic agreements, maintaining the team, carrying out the necessary infrastructure, paying bureaucracies and others. Only a small part of the capital will be allocated to the payment of commissions, Tokenizer, marketing and other elements that prove necessary over time.
The basic infrastructure of each unit in Terra de Satoshi will be provided by Tokenizer, the official partner, to members of Povo de Satoshi. This will be made possible by capital from the sales of tokens related to collections referring to the People or Terra de Satoshi. The goal is to deliver Earth ready so that members can join the corresponding community and start building immediately. In contrast to this, the members of Terra de Satoshi will be responsible for fully structuring the community through the free market. Sectors such as security, health and education will be maintained by the members themselves through individual ventures. This model aims to establish Terra de Satoshi as the most economically free country in history, providing each member the freedom to undertake in any area that contributes to the well-being of the community, with respect for free competition. Tokenizer will accept the sale of tokens exclusively in the bitcoin offering book. All products will be priced in Satoshi, refusing any form of state money.

5.1. Genesis collection:
The first collection to be developed and sold will be "Satoshi's Citizenship". The corresponding tokens will be made available to acquirers through the Tokenizer platform, a partner of Povo de Satoshi. This initial collection of 210,000 tokens represents an opportunity for individuals aligned with the values of Povo de Satoshi to acquire not only active participation in the community, but also a symbolic connection to the collective vision of a decentralized, private society based on the principles and values of freedom.
The proposal consists of issuing 210,000 Satoshi citizenships for each unit built in the world. Terra de Satoshi aims to be the first decentralized country, seeking to own a piece of land, or more, on each continent. Each unit purchased will open a new collection of 210,000 citizenships, introducing new official members of Povo de Satoshi!
When we conquer our first community, making our first piece of land official in the world, we will have a collection of 210 thousand citizenships. When we acquire a second portion of land, a new collection with another 210,000 citizenships will be made available, and so on.
This approach follows the principle of scarcity economics, as supply is limited to 210,000 citizens for each development of a new community. With the constant increase in the world's population, the exponential growth of Bitcoiners over time, and the official recognition of Povo de Satoshi by the UN, we believe that demand will always exceed supply. It is possible that eventually the demand for Satoshi's citizenship will exceed the existing supply, causing appreciation of the representative digital assets. The subjectivity of value also plays a significant role, as participants in the first collection may perceive an added value compared to the last collection, due to subjective factors that influence prices.

5.1.1. Tokenomics:
Terra de Satoshi will be divided into 1 million tokens, representing fractional units of the total property. Of those, 210,000 tokens belong to the initial “Satoshi’s Citizenship” collection, and the remaining tokens shall be integrated in further collections.

5.2 Token collections:
Satoshi Citizenship (21%): The first collection, consisting of 210 thousand tokens, represents the foundational base. Each Satoshi Citizenship token is equivalent to 0.0001% of total ownership, providing active participation in the project. This means that upon full completion of the marketing of the Satoshi Citizenship Collection, 21% of the first Terra de Satoshi unit will have been sold. This will result in the decentralization of the country.

Other Collections (79%): The remaining 79,000 tokens will be allocated to several subsequent collections, including residential land, commercial land, embassy and other categories. These collections will be launched later, diversifying investment and participation opportunities. When all other collections are sold, 100% of the first unit of Terra de Satoshi will have been sold, completing the cycle of its total decentralization.

Token distribution reflects our commitment to decentralization, providing members of Povo de Satoshi with gradual entry into different aspects of Terra de Satoshi. Each token purchased contributes to the construction and growth of this unique ecosystem. This model incorporates the concept of financial democracy, where the individual investment of members of Povo de Satoshi determines their proportional influence in voting. The greater a member's investment, the greater their weight in the collective's decisions. The strength of the vote is proportional to the tokens acquired regardless of the collection that token belongs to.

5.3 Exercise of citizenship
         The citizenship token will work as follows:
The citizenship collection represents 21% of each unit in Terra de Satoshi.
Provides greater active and financial participation of acquiring members with Povo de Satoshi.
210 thousand Satoshi citizenship tokens represent 21% of each unit of Terra de Satoshi. In other words, each token purchased provides the buyer with a proportional fraction of the nation's ownership.

         Holders of Satoshi Citizenship will also enjoy the following benefits:
Share in the first community in Terra de Satoshi
Right to a future passport
Price for residents and not tourists
Networking
Registration of the name in history

Note: Once we obtain international recognition and authorization to issue a passport, the token holder will need to cover the difference in cost for issuance, if they choose to do so. The token grants the right to obtain the passport, but the production cost will be the responsibility of the token holder.


5.4. “Satoshi’s Citizenship” Main Aspects:
Tokenizer undertakes to launch the 210 thousand tokens at a fixed price of 210 thousand Satoshi (0.0021 bitcoins) per unit until the full commercialization of the collection is completed. Regardless of the exchange rate in any state currency.
If the member wishes to resell the token before the collection is fully sold, they can place it again in the Tokenizer order book for the same purchase price, recovering the capital invested.
Operating costs will be deducted, such as commission and the part of Tokenizer responsible for intermediating the purchase/sale.
Token resale will take priority over unsold tokens.
After the collection has been fully sold, the tokens can be resold at any price, as long as the new purchasing party accepts the conditions of the statute. If the new purchasing party does not accept the conditions of the statute, the Tokenizer will repurchase the token for the same amount invested, discounting only the parts already pre-established, ensuring the liquidity of the asset, within a period of 21 days.




Fig 5.4.1: Representation of the first unit of Terra de Satoshi



5.5 “Citizenship of Satoshi” implementation:
The amount raised through the sale of 210 thousand tokens for 0.0021 BTC will result in a total of 441 Bitcoins, which will be directly invested in the formation of Povo de Satoshi, keeping the team active in the development of the project, acquiring areas of land around the world, covering costs related to bureaucracy in general and subsidizing the necessary infrastructure.

If 21% of Terra de Satoshi is equivalent to 441 bitcoins, then 100% of the country's total would correspond to 2,100 bitcoins. We chose to use the sacred number 21 as a metric whenever possible.


Of the first 21% sold of the first unit of Terra de Satoshi, the amounts will be allocated as follows:
2.1% for commission
2.1% for Tokenizer
6.3% for marketing
1.5% for emergency reserve

Totaling 12% (21 in reverse) of the amount. The remainder of the cash, that is, 88%, will be used to acquire land for the construction of the first Terra de Satoshi unit, investment in necessary infrastructure, and payment of the general expenses involved in making the project a reality.

The resources from the sale of future collections, including the sale of land, will have their allocation decided together with Povo de Satoshi.

We will pay 2.1% of the value of each token sold to whoever nominates it. This will provide the appropriate stimulus for people around the world to freely offer the tokens. In case of success in the sale, whoever made the referral will be monetized, thus recognizing justice for their work.

The Tokenizer, the project's official partner, will be entitled to 2.1% of the value of each token sold, in recognition of the development and commercialization of the respective collections.

As this project is for-profit, we believe that profit is ethical and moral, being the main driver of progress. It represents the appropriate stimulus for evolution and the constant search for peaceful solutions to all people's needs.

To carry out the sale of the first Satoshi citizenship collection, we plan to implement a methodology called block mining. We will create 10,000 blocks, each containing 21 tokens. In summary, the sale will total 10,000 blocks, resulting in 210,000 tokens in total. Before each block is mined, i.e. fully commercialized, all details regarding the allocation of funds will be outlined in the project's comprehensive roadmap. Each mined block, sold in its entirety, will represent an increase of 0.0441 bitcoins to the Tokenizer's cash flow. The specific destinations for the amounts collected will be pre-determined before each block is mined. This approach will provide global security and transparency as the wallet will be unique. Given that the Bitcoin timechain is open source, anyone in the world will have the ability and responsibility to audit all inputs and outputs, promoting complete transparency in the process.
We will choose to leverage Bitcoin technology strategically, rather than merely speculating on the currency. The Tokenizer’s wallet will be protected by a multi-signature format, requiring authorization from 7 out of 12 people to move funds. This measure aims to keep the project naturally decentralized, transparent and secure. The people chosen for the multi-signature keys will be selected based on criteria of good heart, pure soul and alignment with the project's core principles and values. These individuals will be public figures spread across the world.
After the commercialization of the "Citizenship of Satoshi" collection, where we will decentralize 21% of the first unit of Terra de Satoshi, we plan to launch other sequential collections, including:
Satoshi Embassy
Residential Land
Commercial Land
Commercial sector (hotels, nightclubs, stores, shopping malls and others)
This approach aims to ensure that, with the commercialization of all these collections, 100% of Terra de Satoshi will be distributed among participants, transforming the project into a fully decentralized initiative.

6. Team
The team will receive the amounts after mining the block, that is, full commercialization, as previously established before being listed in the order book, in addition to having a stake in The Tokenizer. And tokens from Tokenizer itself will also be distributed to team members.
The objective is to guarantee participation in the Tokenizer for everyone involved. The project seeks to fully decentralize Terra de Satoshi, trading 21% initially. The other 79% will be sold in other collections, making the project completely decentralized.
The funds will be stored in:
multiple signature wallet, ensuring security.
Bitcoin and timechain will provide security and transparency.
People committed to the ideals will be chosen to form the team. The Tokenizer will publicly disclose its wallets, allowing audits. Each collection will have its own unique, public wallet. We will only and exclusively accept Bitcoin as a form of payment and all of our tokens will be priced in Satoshi, a fraction of bitcoins.
The project aims to create a unique and inspiring community, guided by libertarian values, decentralization and transparency. This whitepaper represents an innovative social experiment, providing a meaningful alternative for the evolution of society.
This will guarantee the token buyer that the money will only be withdrawn from the Tokenizer wallet after complete execution of what was agreed, before the block is mined. The team that will work on the project is fully aware and agrees to receive payment only after delivering what was agreed, without exceptions.
7. Final considerations;
We thank everyone in the world who took their time to read this document, and we hope to make this dream come true together. We believe the impossible is just a matter of opinion! We understand that the universe is eternally in motion, and everything changes all the time. The human species evolves naturally, and we believe that the current model does not match reality, and it is time to change the way we conduct social organization for those who defend the smallest of minorities: the individual. If you agree with everything exposed here, join us at Povo de Satoshi and help us build the first private and decentralized country of all time! This is the first version of the "general whitepaper". This document will be updated periodically, following the evolution of the project.
Bitcoiners and libertarians around the world, unite!
